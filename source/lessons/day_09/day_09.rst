Day 09 - Rendering / What is Art?
=================================

Fine Art
--------

Why is this considered art? What makes it "good" art? van Gogh was not popular
in his time and died poor and unappreciated. What changed?

Would the 6-year old's drawing below be considered art?
If it is art, is it good art?
What is the difference compared to Vincent van Gogh?
What makes art "good" or "bad"?

Are political cartoons art?
`Search Google <https://www.google.com/search?q=political+cartoons&safe=active&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X>`_
for some cartoons.
I find many of these cartoons to be offensive. Is that still art?

Applied Art
-----------

Can architecture be art? Let's say that this is art. Why is it art?

    Austrailian Museum of the Applied Arts

Is this also art? If it isn't, why not?

What is the purpose of creating a building like the first one? The bottom
one is cheaper, and more energy efficient. When you buy things from the bottom
company, they aren't needlessly spending their money on extra building materials
like the top image.
