Day 05 - Lighting
=================


* Please don't leave before class is over.
* Full schedule is now on-line, both outline and assignments.
* Assignments 1 and 2 are graded
* Work on `Lighting`_ videos next. The HDRi video is extra.
* Do the lighting exercise. It is ungraded, but a good project to try out
  what you've learned.
* At this point you can model, texture, and shade items. If you have free time,
  you can start working on what you want to do for your final project. See
  :ref:`Assignment_06` and :ref:`Final_Project`. Get a jump on these projects.
