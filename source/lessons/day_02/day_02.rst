Day 02
======

Reminders
---------

* Two assignments due tomorrow.
* Yesterday we talked about an artist's ability to convey a message. Remember
  to take a look at **what** the message was, and then **how** it was conveyed.
* Next we worked on videos that covered the basics of Blender and
  covered the basics of Mesh modeling.

Learning Blender Plan
---------------------

The idea is to spend a week and a half on learning Blender. Then switch to
working on the project.

Required Tutorial Videos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `Blender Basics <https://cgcookie.com/course/blender-basics/>`_
* `Mesh Modeling Fundamentals <https://cgcookie.com/course/mesh-modeling-fundamentals/>`_

After this, split out and learn some other things. CG Cookie has 81 different
courses you can go through:

Need a Break?
-------------

Wait! Have you had your fill of tutorial videos? Take a break. But goof off by
doing something your instructor approves of.

Browse CG Art
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* I've checked out copies of `3D World Magazine`_ from the library.
  I'll have them here in class for a while. Look through them.
* Browse the `CG Cookie Gallery`_.
* Spend time browsing `CG Society`_ to get ideas.

Experiment
^^^^^^^^^^

Also, don't hesitate to take a break from the video by experimenting with a
side project. Even if you end up trashing it, you'll still have learned
something.

But don't think to yourself "I'm going to model a city!" Model something simple.
Model a street lamp. A fire hydrant. Any of these could be things that you use
in a city.

Class Discussion
----------------

Rule of Thirds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Talk more about the `Rule of Thirds`_.

.. _Rule of Thirds: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds

Reusing Assets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Talk about the following two images:

.. figure:: 34807_1297991665_large.jpg

  "`Somewhere in Japan <http://shotta.cgsociety.org/art/3ds-max-digital-fusion-photoshop-vray-zbrush-somewhere-in-japan-958529>`_" by Miguel Cruz

.. figure:: 34807_1297992639_large.jpg

  "`Somewhere in Japan Sunset Version <http://shotta.cgsociety.org/art/3ds-max-digital-fusion-photoshop-vray-zbrush-somewhere-in-japan-958534>`_" by Miguel Cruz

Discuss the following points:

* How does the mood change between the sunset and daytime photo?
* What does the artist change in the scene to make things different? List them.
* What items are the same, that might not first be obvious?
* One of the things that a good 3D artist can do to be more effective is reuse
  assets. You can see this in movies where movie sets and props are reused
  in different movies. This is even easier with 3D graphics. Take some time
  to list the different "assets" from this scene that the author could reuse
  somewhere else.

Assignment 3

set of videos.
