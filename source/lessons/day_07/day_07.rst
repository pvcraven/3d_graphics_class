Day 07 - Modifiers
==================

Today we'll talk about Demo Reels, how to download and add models to your
scene from other sources, and how to come up with a project plan.

Demo Reels
----------

A demo reel is a short video production that will showcase your abilities
to a potential employer or client. If you want to get into this line of work,
start working on a demo reel. Continue to work on projects to add to the demo
reel.

Here are some demo reels from individuals. Go through some of the demo reels
and talk about what they do well.

Importing Objects
-----------------

* Create a new file.
* Put down a plane for a floor
* Download :download:`pcraven_stapler.blend<pcraven_stapler.blend>`
  (Note, MS Edge might want to add a ``.htm`` at the end. Chrome doesn't have
  this issue. If you download with Edge, you'll need to change the extension,
  which can be a bit complex if you aren't viewing extensions by default.)
* Download :download:`pcraven_wood_chair3.blend<pcraven_wood_chair3.blend>`
* See how to append them.
* Look at:

  * `Blend Swap`_
  * `Sketchfab`_
  * `Turbosquid <https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/3D-Models/free/blend>`_
