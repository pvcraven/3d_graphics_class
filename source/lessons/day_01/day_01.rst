Today we will introduce the course. Talk about communicating through art
using the movie Sintel as an example. Finally we'll learn some technical skills
in running Blender.

Introduction
------------

* Go over syllabus

* This class uses some video tutorials.
  Why are we using video tutorials?

  * You can easily stop and replay the video if you didn't catch where to click
    or what key to hit.
  * It keeps other people from being halted when someone has a question.
  * Videos allow for self-paced study. Not everyone is going to learn this at
    the same speed.
  * They free up the instructor to have more time to answer questions.
  * It allows students to customize what topics are learned. Students can
    spend time on animation tutorials, tutorials on modeling a face,
    texturizing, etc.
  * There are a lot of high-quality tutorials out there, no need to re-invent
    the wheel.
  * People who are away for sports during May Term can stay caught up.

* How much work is expected?

  * Be in class every day, all during the class time.
  * Do not leave class early.
  * Plan to spend at least 1.5 hours per day learning and creating with 3D
    graphics outside of class. More if you want to get an A.
  * There are enough materials to keep someone occupied for years learning
    Blender. There will be no problem finding enough material to learn.

How did Sintel Use Art to Communicate?
--------------------------------------

* View `Sintel movie <http://www.sintel.org/>`_. Sintel was created with Blender
  back in 2011.
* Examine video stills from movie. What is being conveyed? How?
* What to look for:

  * Lighting
  * Shapes
  * Camera angles
  * Position in the frame
  * Focus/depth of field
  * Color
  * Blur
  * Reflectivity
  * Posture
  * Facial expression
  * Eyes
  * Eyebrows
  * Mouth

For :ref:`Assignment_01` I am looking for you to pick an image and do the same
type of analysis. Look at the types of things we called out in the images, and
write up what the artist's message was by using these cues.

Beginning to Learning Blender
-----------------------------

    :class: right-image

* Go over the :ref:`final_project` so you know where we are headed.
* There will be about nine assignments before the final project.
* We will be working through part of CG Cookie's
  `Learn Blender 2.8 and beyond <https://cgcookie.com/flow/learn-blender-2-8-your-complete-tutorial-guide>`_ flow.
* Today:

  * Work through `Blender Basics Course <https://cgcookie.com/course/learn-blender-2-8-the-basics-tutorial>`_

    * Starting with Chapter 2,
      `Learning to navigate the Blender interface <https://cgcookie.com/lesson/introduction-to-blender-s-interface>`_
    * Finish Chapter 3 "Begin working within 3D". Last video should be "Primitive Modeling Exercise"

* Finish :ref:`Assignment_01` and :ref:`Assignment_02`. These are due Wednesday
  morning, but I suggest treating the assignments like they are due Tuesday
  morning.
* Continue working on Chapter 4 "Taking it a step further with Mesh Modeling"
  in the tutorial. Skip the "Mesh modeling exercise", we'll do something similar
  tomorrow.
