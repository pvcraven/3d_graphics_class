Day 01
======

Introduction
------------

* Go over syllabus

* This class uses a lot of video tutorials.
  Why are we using video tutorials?

  * You can easily stop and replay the video if you didn't catch where to click
    or what key to hit.
  * It keeps other people from being halted when someone has a question.
  * Videos allow for self-paced study. Not everyone is going to learn this at
    the same speed.
  * They free up the instructor to have more time to answer questions.
  * It allows students to customize what topics are learned. Students can
    spend time on animation tutorials, tutorials on modeling a face,
    texturizing, etc.
  * There are a lot of high-quality tutorials out there, no need to re-invent
    the wheel.
  * People who are away for sports during May Term can stay caught up.

* How much work is expected?

  * Be in class every day, all during the class time.
  * Do not leave class early. It sometimes ok to relocate to the general lab
    or the cs lab, but any time you do this please get permission first.
  * Plan to spend at least 1.5 hours per day learning and creating with 3D
    graphics outside of class. More if you want to get an A.
  * We have enough materials to keep someone occupied for years learning
    Blender. There will be no problem finding enough material to learn.

How did Sintel Use Art to Communicate?
--------------------------------------

* View `Sintel movie <http://www.sintel.org/>`_. Sintel was created with BLender
  back in 2011.
* Examine video stills from movie. What is being conveyed? How?
* What to look for:

  * Lighting
  * Shapes
  * Camera angles
  * Position in the frame
  * Focus/depth of field
  * Color
  * Blur
  * Reflectivity
  * Posture
  * Facial expression
  * Eyes
  * Eyebrows
  * Mouth

* Go over the :ref:`final_project` so you know where we are headed.
* There will be a total of nine assignments before the final project.
* We will be working through part of CG Cookie's `Introduction to Blender`_ flow.
* Today:

  * Work through `Blender Basics Course`_
  * Work through `Mesh Modeling Fundamentals`_
  * Make sure all video tutorials are done by start of next class
  * Work on `Mesh Modeling Exercise 01`_
  * Have extra time? Work more tutorials from the `Introduction to Blender`_ flow.
    Some of these will be assigned, some will be optional.
  * The quicker the tutorials are completed, the more time will be available
    for creating a movie or graphic stills.

* Finish :ref:`Assignment_01` and :ref:`Assignment_02`. These are due Wednesday
  morning, but I suggest treating the assignments like they are due Tuesday
  morning.
