Day 01
======

* Go over syllabus

  * Why are we using video tutorials?

    * They allow for self-paced study.
    * They free up the instructor to have more time to answer questions.
    * It keeps other people from being halted when someone has a question.
    * It allows students to customize what topics are learned. Students can
      spend time on animation tutorials, tutorials on modeling a face,
      texturizing, etc.
    * There are a lot of high-quality tutorials out there, no need to re-invent
      the wheel.
    * People who are away for sports can stay caught up.

  * How much work is expected?

    * Be in class every day, all during the class time.
    * Do not leave class early. It sometimes ok to relocate to the general lab
      or the cs lab, but any time you do this please get permission first.
    * Plan to spend at least 1.5 hours per day learning and creating with 3D
      graphics outside of class. More if you want to get an A.
    * We have enough materials to keep someone occupied for years learning
      Blender. There will be no problem finding enough material to keep busy.
