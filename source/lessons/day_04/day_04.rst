Day 4 - Lighting / Materials
============================

Two main goals for today. First, talk about art telling a story. Second,
learn about lighting and art.

Don't forget to finish modeling :ref:`model-bedroom`. We'll be introducing lighting
in today's videos.

* :ref:`Assignment_03` is due today, Thursday
* :ref:`Assignment_04` is due Friday
* :ref:`Assignment_05` is due Tuesday

Eevee vs Cycles
---------------

Take the default scene. Add a large plane and put below the cube.

Switch view to 'rendered'.

Talk about rendering engines. We'll talk about accuracy vs.
time in rendering speed. What the differences between Eevee and Cycles are,
and how to switch blender between the two.

This video introduces the "node editor." Depending on your experience level, it
can be exciting or a horrifying mess of lines and boxes. (Or both.) It allows
you to create incredibly detailed and realistic materials. For this class, you
don't really need that level of detail. I'm just providing this video as an
introduction to let people know it is there if you are interested.

Done with the videos? Finish your low-poly bedroom.
Apply what you've learned to light that room.
