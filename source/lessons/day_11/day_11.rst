Fine Art

Why is this considered art? What makes it "good" art?

The famous painting
"`Sunflowers <https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0031V1962>`_"
below is by Vincent van Gogh.
He was not popular
in his time and died poor and unappreciated.
`Now, he is considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time <https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vincent-van-Gogh>`_.
Why is this art?
What do you think the artist is trying to communicate?

Would the 6-year old's drawing below be considered art?
If it is art, is it good art?
What is the difference compared to Vincent van Gogh?
What makes art "good" or "bad"?

Graphic design for commercial products. Is it art? If our message is to
"Buy Cheerios" is that still art?

Are cartoons art? From newspaper comics to graphic art novels?
Do things need to be serious to be considered art?

Are political cartoons art?
`Search Google <https://www.google.com/search?q=political+cartoons&safe=active&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X>`_
for some cartoons.
I find many of these cartoons to be offensive. Is that still art?

How about this, is it art?

Is creating realistic looking paintings, drawings, or CG graphics art?
If realism is the ultimate goal, wouldn't a photograph be the king of artists?
(James McNeill Whistler)

Decorative Art
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What do you decorate your room with? What does it communicate? Why is it important?

* Flowers
* Crafts
* Posters

Applied Art
-----------

* Architecture (Frank Lloyd Wright to a cookie-cutter house)
* Design of things (chairs, lamps, etc.)

Can architecture be art? Let's say that this is art. Why is it art?

.. figure:: building1.jpg

    Austrailian Museum of the Applied Arts

Is this also art? If it isn't, why not?
What message does this office layout convey, as opposed to the other
image?

.. figure:: office.jpg

    Randall Fisher Construction Co

What is the purpose of creating a building like the first one? The bottom
one is cheaper, and more energy efficient. When you buy things from the bottom
company, they aren't needlessly spending their money on extra building materials
like the top image.

.. figure:: capital.jpg

    `Wasteful and inefficient Iowa Capital building <http://maxpixel.freegreatpicture.com/Inside-Government-Iowa-Des-Moines-State-Capitol-1731557>`_

.. figure:: leds.jpg

    `Award winning interior of IPERS building <http://www.ledsmagazine.com/articles/iif/2012/12/iowa-government-building-slashes-electrical-load-70-with-acuity-lighting-and-controls.html>`_

Both of the above images are award-winning designs. The bottom one is efficient.
The top isn't.

The Carver building atrium was very controversial when it was designed. It was
a lot of wasted space. Was it worth doing? Is it art? What do you think of the
Kent student center atrium?

Visual/Performance Art
----------------------

* Theater (Acting can go from plays, Broadway, sitcoms, or even commercials)
* Ballet
* Poetry slams

Does art need to be a physical thing? Why would we consider this to be art?

Music is incredibly important to people. Why? Why is it important to you?

This song was famous, mostly for all the wrong reasons. Would you consider
it art? Why or why not?
