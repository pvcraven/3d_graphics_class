Day 08 - Animation
==================

Prep for Day 09

Start thinking about the question, "What is Art?" Here are two sources
to get you started:

* `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Art%3F>`_
* `Mental Floss <http://mentalfloss.com/article/57501/27-responses-question-what-art>`_

Think, at what point do things in the following categories become art?

What about controversial art? Is it still art? If it offends, is it still ok?
