Prep for Day 09
---------------

Start thinking about the question, "What is Art?" Here are two sources
to get you started:

* `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Art%3F>`_
* `Mental Floss <http://mentalfloss.com/article/57501/27-responses-question-what-art>`_

Think, at what point do things in the following categories become art?

What about controversial art? Is it still art? If it offends, is it still ok?

Fine Art
^^^^^^^^

Drawing, sculpting, printmaking

* Cartoons (political cartoons, graphic novels, humor cartoons)
* A first-grader's drawing
* The design of a Cheerios box (or any other commercial-type work)
* Graffiti
* Penmanship

Music
^^^^^

* Classical music
* Rock music
* Pop music (Auto-tune?)

Visual/Performance Art
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Theater (Acting can go from plays, Broadway, sitcoms, or even commercials)

* What is the plot of the movie?
* What is the message?
* Do the artists accomplish the message?
* How could it have been better?


Importing Objects
-----------------

* Create a new file.
* Put down a plane for a floor
* Download :download:`pcraven_stapler.blend<pcraven_stapler.blend>`
  (Note, MS Edge might want to add a ``.htm`` at the end. Chrome doesn't have
  this issue. If you download with Edge, you'll need to change the extension,
  which can be a bit complex if you aren't viewing extensions by default.)
* Download :download:`pcraven_wood_chair3.blend<pcraven_wood_chair3.blend>`
* See how to append them.
* Look at:

  * `Blend Swap`_
  * `Sketchfab`_
  * `Turbosquid <https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/3D-Models/free/blend>`_
