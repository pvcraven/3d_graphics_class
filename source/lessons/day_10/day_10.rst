Prep for Day 11
---------------

Start thinking about the question, "What is Art?" Here are two sources
to get you started:

* `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Art%3F>`_
* `Mental Floss <http://mentalfloss.com/article/57501/27-responses-question-what-art>`_

Think:

* What categories of things are considered art?
* At what point does something become art?
* How important is it to create in art?
* What about controversial art? Is it still art? If it offends, is it still ok?
* How important is art to you personally?
* Is commercial art still art?
