`What is Art? <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art>`_

Fine Art
--------

Why is this considered art? What makes it "good" art?

The famous painting below is by Vincent van Gogh.
He was not popular
in his time and died poor and unappreciated. Why is this art?

Would the 6-year old's drawing below be considered art?
If it is art, is it good art?
What is the difference compared to Vincent van Gogh?
What makes art "good" or "bad"?

Are political cartoons art?
`Search Google <https://www.google.com/search?q=political+cartoons&safe=active&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X>`_
for some cartoons.
I find many of these cartoons to be offensive. Is that still art?

How about this, is it art?

Applied Art

Can architecture be art? Let's say that this is art. Why is it art?

Is this also art? If it isn't, why not?

What is the purpose of creating a building like the first one? The bottom
one is cheaper, and more energy efficient. When you buy things from the bottom
company, they aren't needlessly spending their money on extra building materials
like the top image.

Why support art?
----------------

* Why buy art?

  * Buy art at art fairs?
  * Buy tickets to movies?
  * Art and usage rights

* Why have public support for the arts?

  * Why have band, orchestra, and art at school?
  * Why have a "National Endowment for the Arts"?
