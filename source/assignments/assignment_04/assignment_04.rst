========================

Look at this image:

.. figure:: 68732_1279129309_large.jpg

    Image by Marek Denko

First, briefly describe the **aesthetic** of this image. Explain at
two principles of art used here.

Second, write a back-story to the image. Don't tell me about the image, but
spend some time telling me a story that the image is a part of.

Open the image in a new tab or zoom in on it. Don't miss seeing the woman
in the background.

Please include:

* Name
* Title
* At least a 2/3 page back-story to the image.
* Double-space.
* Use paragraphs. If you only have one or two paragraphs, you aren't using enough.
* Proof grammar/spelling.
* Write this as a story, not observations with possible explanations.
