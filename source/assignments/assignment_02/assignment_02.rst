* Name your file ``primitive_modeling.blend``. (Your file system might hide the ``.blend`` and only show you the title.
  Blender might create backup files with names ending in ``.blend1``. These are **not** the files you want to upload
  as they typically hold a previous version of your work.)
* Complete the
  `Primitive Modeling Exercise <https://cgcookie.com/lesson/primitive-modeling-exercise>`_.
  Use primitives, the ability to move them and scale the objects to create something of
  your own design.
* Upload the resulting Blender file here.
* In the comments, please state if it is ok to show your work here,
  and if it is ok, how you'd like to be attributed.

.. tip::

  If you are looking for more than a "C", make sure to spend time adding detail
  to your model.
