Assignment 2 - Mesh Modeling
============================

* Name your file ``mesh_modeling_exercise_01_first_last.blend``, but replace ``first``
  with your first name and ``last`` with your last name.
* Complete `Mesh Modeling Exercise 01`_. No need to upload to SketchFab or submit via
  CG Cookie. We'll just upload to Scholar instead.
* Please try the corner cut-outs of the cube. They are a good challenge.
* If you aren't sure how to use the knife tool to create a straight cut across the
  cone, ask. Using the "C" key to clamp and the "Z" key to cut all the way through
  are important tricks.
* Complete as one file. Please don't zip three files together and upload.
