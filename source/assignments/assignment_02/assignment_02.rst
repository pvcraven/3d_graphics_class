* Name your file ``primitive_modeling.blend``
* Complete the

  Use primitives, the ability to move them and scale the objects to create something of
  your own design.
* Upload the resulting Blender file here.

.. tip::

  If you are looking for more than a "C", make sure to spend time adding detail
  to your model.
