Watch the "animation tools" portion of the `Fundamentals of Animation`_. Again,
you don't have to watch the "animation principles" part.

This assignment is to see if you know how to do the basics of animation taught
in the videos.

1. Start off with a blank Blender file.
2. Choose the "cycles" or use the default "blender render" engine.
3. Add a floor to your scene.
4. Light the scene a bit better.
5. Add three cubes to the scene.
6. Give the cubes different colors. Leave the floor white. I'm grading the
   animation, so keep the cube materials simple. Don't add gloss or reflection.
7. Use what you learned from the videos to animate the three cubes. You might
   need to change the frame count from the default.
8. Also move the camera.
9. Go to the "Render" settings
10. Keep the default 50% of the 1920x1080 resolution. You can go lower if needed
    to speed things up.
11. Change output type from PNG to "H.264"
12. Select an output folder, and (optionally) a name.
13. If you are using cycles, try taking the "Render" sample count down to 16 to make it
    render fast enough. You might need even lower depending on your computer
    and the frame count.
14. Select "Render image" to make sure it looks right.
15. Select "Render animation"
16. Be bored while it renders. If it looks like it will take to long, lower
    the resolution and samples.
17. Upload and turn in the movie and the Blender file.
