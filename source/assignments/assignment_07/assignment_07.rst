Assignment 7 - Animation
========================

Your goal is to create an animation like this:


.. raw:: html

   <video controls style='width: 80%;'>
    <source src="../../_static/snow_people.mp4"  type='video/mp4'>
   </video>

Your video should have:

* Create some kind of ground.
* Create a simple object. Such as a simple car, snow person, airplane,
  stick-figure dog, or anything incredibly easy to model so that you aren't
  spending all your time modeling.
* Add least three objects to your scene. You can create three copies of the object,
  that's ok. You might color them differently so  that you've got a bit of
  variety.
* Animate the three objects.
* Also animate the camera.

Optional:

* Add an HDRI image.

Turn in a .blend file and a movie with your animation.
