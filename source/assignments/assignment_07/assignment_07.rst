Assignment 7 - Animation
========================

Your goal is to create an animation like this:


.. raw:: html

   <video controls style='width: 80%;'>
    <source src="../../_static/snow_people.mp4"  type='video/mp4'>
   </video>

Your video should have:

* Create some kind of ground.
* Create a simple object. Such as a simple car, snow person, airplane,
  stick-figure dog, or anything incredibly easy to model so that you aren't
  spending all your time modeling.
* Add least three objects to your scene. You can create three copies of the object,
  that's ok. You might color them differently so  that you've got a bit of
  variety.
* Animate the three objects. One of which can be the camera.

Optional:

* Add an HDRI image. Do not pick an HDRI bigger than 5 MB, or you won't be
  able to upload your submission.

Double-Check Your Turn In!
--------------------------

.. image:: check.svg
    :width: 20%
    :class: right-image

These are some spots where people have lost points. Double-check before turning
in your assignment!

* Make sure three items are animated.
* If you have an image, make sure to do File...External Data...Automatically Pack Into Blend
* Upload your Blender file (not the ``.blend1`` file)
* Upload your rendered movie
* If you use any external image, don't forget to cite it. See :ref:`citing`.
