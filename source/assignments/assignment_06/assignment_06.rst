Assignment 6 - Final Project Plan
=================================

Final Project Plan
------------------

For this assignment you will put together a plan for your final project. You
can feel free to change your plan later as you work on your project. I don't
need to see any revised plans nor do you need approval to change your project.
This assignment is an opportunity to think about what you want to create.

Create a MS Word document and put your name at the top. If you are working in
a team, you can have up to three people. List each person at the top. Select
someone from your team to turn in the final copy. Please do not turn in three
copies of the same plan.

Everyone in the team will receive the same score for
this project plan assignment. For the final project,
if a team member fails to contribute they will be dropped from the project
and not given a score, or have a significantly reduced score.

Your project plan will be divided into three sections, described below.

Artistic Expression
-------------------

What is the idea behind your project? What is your artist's message?

For this section you need the following:

1. Think up an initial working title for your project.
2. List two artistic goals for each person on your team, and how you plan on
   accomplishing them.

For example, if you are planning on creating suspense, that would be a goal.
You might plan on accomplishing that feeling by using lighting that creates
long shadows and adding suspenseful music to your video.

Technical
---------

Now is the time to think about how you plan on technically
accomplishing your artistic goals. Take some time think about what you've
already learned and know how to do. Look at Blender Guru, Blender Cookie,
and see what other tutorials are out there. Figure out which ones might apply
to your artistic goals. Looking at the tutorials available might produce ideas
for artistic goals.

For each artistic goal listed above, think about technically how you plan on
accomplishing it. If you've found tutorials that will help, list those
tutorials you plan on using. For example, if your artistic goal is to create
a feeling of cold, you could use a tutorial on how to create frosted glass.

For this section of your plan:

1. List two technically challenging items for each person on your team.
2. List any tutorials or resources you plan on using to learn how to accomplish
   those goals.

Project Plan
------------

There will be two weeks to work on your project. Create a project plan for
what you will do during these two weeks.

I recommend planning your project in "stages." Create your project in a rough
form that isn't very detailed, and then plan on what you'll sink your time into.

For example, if you are looking to have a car drive down the road, start with a
rough box-model of the car and animate it and light it. Then plan on spending
two days adding detail to the model of the car. Another two days on animating
it going down the road. Two days on creating a landscape. A day adding in smoke
from spinning tires. Another day adding a sound track.

If you get behind, make sure your plan allows you to still have a viable
project at the end. One year I had a student create a wonderfully detailed
tire, but ran out of time to create a car that went with it. So at the end
there was just an animation of a tire rolling down the road.

For this section of your plan do the following:

1. Create a day-by-day schedule for the rest of the term. Remember that the
   last day will be presentations, and it will not be a work-day.
2. List two items for each person in your team that you plan on spending a
   lot of time doing detail work with.

Submitting
----------

Before you submit: Check you spelling. Check the grammar. Make certain your
plan is well organized and easy to read. Bullet points and lists are ok,
but the entire thing shouldn't be lists. There should be some written discussion
of what you are creating.
