Create an MS Word document (or PDF)

1. Put your name, the date, and a title at the top.
2. Put which image number you picked.
3. List three feelings, emotions, message, or other aspects that the image
   conveys. Make it easy for me to find your three items.

   feeling/emotion/message/whatever.

I'm looking for at least 3/4 of a page.

Spelling and grammar count. Do not forget about things like thesis statements,
topic sentences, and paragraphs. Do not give me a solid wall of text.

Please review the
`PIE Paragraph Structure <https://awc.ashford.edu/essay-dev-pie-paragraph.html>`_
if needed.

Here are some words people have gotten confused on in prior years:

* Innocents is not the same as Innocence.
* Eloquent is not the same as Elegant.
* Too, to, and two are different words.
* Loose and lose are also different words.
* Don't forget the classic: there, their, and there.
