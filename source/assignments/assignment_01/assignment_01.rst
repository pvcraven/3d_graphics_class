Pick one of the following images that artists have posted on the
CGSociety_ website.

.. _CGSociety: http://www.cgsociety.org/

* `Image 1 <https://cgsociety.org/c/featured/i9la/chirstmas-empty-city>`_ by Korean artist "ggaburi"
* `Image 2 <https://cgsociety.org/c/featured/2sn1/zohlof>`_ by Egyptian artist "momenelwan"
* `Image 3 <https://cgsociety.org/c/featured/hwyt/frozen-land>`_ by Brazilian artist "Porto Alegre"
* `Image 4 <https://cgsociety.org/c/featured/dfpr/sci-fi-environment-d>`_ by Nellie Norton
* `Image 5 <https://cgsociety.org/c/editors-pick/u592/black-mamba>`_ by Ukrainian artist "Ant-Onix"

Some of the pages have views of the same artwork. Just write about the first one.

Create an MS Word document (or PDF)

1. Put your name, the date, and a title at the top.
2. Put which image number you picked.
3. List two **messages**, and two **aesthetic responses** that the image
   communicates. Make it easy for me to find your four items.
4. For each item, list how the artist has gone about conveying that
   message, or aesthetic. For the aesthetic, consider what we discussed with
   :ref:`principles`:
   
   * color
   * form
   * line
   * shape
   * space
   * texture/pattern/rhythm
   * scale
   * proportion
   * unity/variety
   * movement
   * mass
   * balance (symmetry, asymmetry, radial symmetry)
   * contrast (difference between objects)
   * volume
   * perspective (camera angles)
   * depth (focus/depth of field)

   You can also look at:
   
   * Lighting
   * Position in the frame
   * Blur
   * Reflectivity
   * Human expression

       * Posture
       * Facial expression
       * Eyes
       * Eyebrows
       * Mouth

I'm looking for *at least* one full double-spaced page.

Spelling and grammar count. Do not forget about things like thesis statements,
topic sentences, and paragraphs. Do not give me a solid wall of text.
Separate each question's response into its own paragraph.

Please review the
`PIE Paragraph Structure <https://awc.ashford.edu/essay-dev-pie-paragraph.html>`_
if needed. Paragraphs should average about five sentences. If you turn in just
one long paragraph I won't read it.

Here are some words people have gotten confused on in prior years:

* Innocents is not the same as Innocence.
* Eloquent is not the same as Elegant.
* Too, to, and two are different words.
* Loose and lose are also different words.
* Don't forget the classic: there, their, and there.
