Some of the pages have views of the same artwork. Just write about the first one.

Create an MS Word document (or PDF)

1. Put your name, the date, and a title at the top.
2. Put which image number you picked.
3. List two **messages**, and two **aesthetic responses** that the image
   communicates. Make it easy for me to find your four items.
4. For each item, list how the artist has gone about conveying that
   message, or aesthetic. I'm specifically interested in how these elements
   are used:
   
   * color
   * form
   * line
   * shape
   * space
   * texture

   How these principals are used:

   * scale
   * proportion
   * unity
   * variety
   * rhythm
   * mass
   * shape
   * space
   * balance
   * volume
   * perspective
   * depth

   And this
   
   * Lighting
   * Camera angles
   * Position in the frame
   * Focus/depth of field
   * Color
   * Blur
   * Reflectivity
   * Posture
   * Facial expression
   * Eyes
   * Eyebrows
   * Mouth

5. The elements of art are color, form, line, shape, space, and texture. The principles of art are scale, proportion, unity, variety, rhythm, mass, shape, space, balance, volume, perspective, and depth.

I'm looking for at least one full double spaced page.

Spelling and grammar count. Do not forget about things like thesis statements,
topic sentences, and paragraphs. Do not give me a solid wall of text.
Seperate each question's response into its own paragraph.

Please review the
`PIE Paragraph Structure <https://awc.ashford.edu/essay-dev-pie-paragraph.html>`_
if needed. Paragraphs should average about five sentences. If you turn in just
one long paragraph I won't read it.

Here are some words people have gotten confused on in prior years:

* Innocents is not the same as Innocence.
* Eloquent is not the same as Elegant.
* Too, to, and two are different words.
* Loose and lose are also different words.
* Don't forget the classic: there, their, and there.
