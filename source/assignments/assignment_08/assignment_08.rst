Assignment 8 - What is Art?
===========================

*This section hasn't been updated for 2021 yet.*


Upload a one to two page double-spaced essay covering the following question:

"What is Art?""

See `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Art%3F>`_, `Mental Floss <http://mentalfloss.com/article/57501/27-responses-question-what-art>`_ and find your own sources elsewhere.

You may eventually refer to these sources, but don't quote them.
Do **not** start any paper with a definition quoted from the dictionary or
Wikipedia. That is a terrible thing to do.

Please don't say that "art is different things to different people." That isn't
very informative.

This essay may
be semi-reflective, so you can include  1st person if you want. It should include

* Introduction
* Thesis
* Paragraphs with a Purpose, Information, and Explanation (PIE)
* Double-check that your paragraphs aren't longer that 1/3 of a page.
* Conclusion
