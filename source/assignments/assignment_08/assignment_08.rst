Assignment 8 - What is Art?
===========================

Upload a 1.5 to 2.5 page double-spaced essay covering the following questions:

* "What is Art?"
* What is the value of art, and art institutions in human society? (Musical concerts, theater, literary publications, etc.)

See `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Art%3F>`_, `Mental Floss <http://mentalfloss.com/article/57501/27-responses-question-what-art>`_ and find your own sources elsewhere.

You may eventually refer to these sources, but don't quote them.
Do **not** start any paper with a definition quoted from the dictionary or
Wikipedia. That is a terrible thing to do.

Art is hard to define. But please avoid phrases that are so vague they add nothing to the
discussion, or can easily be disproven:

* Art is different things to different people.
* Art can be anything.

This essay may
be semi-reflective, so you can include  1st person if you want. It should include

* Introduction
* Thesis (usually last sentence of introduction)
* Paragraphs with a Purpose, Information, and Explanation (PIE)
* Double-check that your paragraphs aren't longer that 1/3 of a page.
* Conclusion
* Bibliography in MLA format if you need to cite anything
