Assignment 5 - Modifiers
========================

Complete the `Modeling a Wheel <https://cgcookie.com/exercise/model-a-wheel/>`_
exercise from the videos.

Turn in a rendered image and a ``.blend`` file. Please do not "zip" anything.

To render the image you'll
likely need to spend a bit of time figuring out how to put the wheel in front
of the camera. You don't need to add textures.
